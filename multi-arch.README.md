# SwiftLint Multi-Arch

This fork of Swiftlint contains a [build script](./script/build-multi-arch-docker-image.sh) that helps building a
multi-arch docker image for Swiftlint. The image supports arm64 and amd64 and it uses a [multi-arch Swift image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ataias/swift) as well.
